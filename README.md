##Pixlee- Instagram

 This is a  simple web app to showcase Instagram's pictures. The user can search through photos by tag and date.The user can also make an account and create a gallery where the photos can be saved.

 Gems that were used:

* 1) Instagram: The Instagram gem is a ruby API gem that helps and simplifies the process to pull Instagram photos into the web app.


* 2) React-rails: React-rails makes it simpler to user React and JSX in the application



* 3) Figaro: Figaro makes it easier to configure the application in a secure method.

  * What was done for Back-end: In terms of back-end, I created a rails app and I created a model where I am saving the gallery information, in addition to routes and creating the MVC model.

  * What was done for Front-end: In terms of front-end, I used React to showcase the gallery's show page, javascript to be able to save a photo in a gallery and CSS to make the page look nicer.

   <br>Features that were added:

  * Search through Instagram's photos by hashtag and date

  * A user is able to create an account and login

  * A user is able to create a gallery

  * A user is able to save photos into the gallery
